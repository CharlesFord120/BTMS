# BTMS
First Revision of the Battery Temperature Monitoring System

To build this on the Arduino MKRZERO

# IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE

You will need to install the Arduino Extension.

Using the command palette you will need to open Board Manager and search for "Zero" and install "Arduino SAMD Boards (32-bits ARM Cortex-M0+)". This will install all the necessary files to communicate with the MKRZERO board. (You may need to reinstall if you are getting errors).

Again using the command palette you need to open the Board Configuration and choose the MKRZERO option to interface with the board.

Again using the command palette you need to open the Select Serial Port and select what ever COM port your Arduino is set-up on. This might change when uploading code so make sure to check it if you are having issues.

In the top right of the screen you will see a build option this is what will build and upload the code to the board.
